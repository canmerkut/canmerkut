# About Me

Hello, I'm Can Merkut, a software developer with a passion for crafting tailored solutions. 

- 💼 I specialize in building custom software for businesses using PHP.
- 🌟 Since 2022, I've been experimenting with C# and Python as part of my hobby projects.
- 🌐 My work revolves around research and development, and I often dive into Russian and Spanish sources to expand my knowledge.

## Goals

I have several ambitious goals, and one of my primary objectives is to develop a user-friendly CMS (Content Management System) with a NoSQL database. This CMS aims to provide a straightforward and efficient solution for managing digital content, making it accessible to a wide range of users.

In addition to the CMS project, I'm also working on:

- 🌱 Developing soilless plant cultivation systems.
- 🚀 Creating a high-speed, specialized NoSQL database.
- 🌐 Building a social interaction platform.
